"""
gdp_reactor.py

The code build the series of Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor models for the Generalized Disjunctive Programming superstructure. 
The CSTRs have a autocatalytic reaction A + B -> 2B and the objective function is to minimizes total reactor network volume. 
The code contains the mass and reaction balances, the logic constraints, and the objective function.
The logical constraints are the existance of the recycle flow and bypass flow, and the existance of the CSTRs.
The complete model defines a Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) problem.

This model is to be imported by main_cstr.py where it is solved via differente solution methods (MINLP reformulation, GDP algorithms, and L-DSDA).
